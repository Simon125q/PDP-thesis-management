Importing Archival Data into the Database:

1. Download the files `fillDatabase.py` and `clearDatabase.py`, and enable editing and execution of the scripts.
2. Replace the values of `PATH_TO_EXCEL` and `PATH_TO_DATABASE` in both files with the paths to the Excel file containing archival data and the `diploma_database.db` database, respectively.
3. Run the `clearDatabase.py` file to ensure the database is empty.
4. Run the `fillDatabase.py` file (All typos and records without thesis-related data are handled within the script).

**Important Note:** Data newer than September 2, 2024, is not included, and it is required to ensure their complete correctness.
